## Description

This collaborative project forms an integral component of the Holberton School Full-Stack Software Engineer curriculum, representing the outset of crafting an AirBnB replica. Within this project phase, we construct a tailored command-line interface for effective data administration while simultaneously laying the foundation for data storage through the establishment of fundamental classes. Users, through the utilization of console commands, have the capability to generate, modify, and delete objects, along with overseeing file storage. The system utilizes JSON serialization/deserialization to ensure enduring storage across sessions.
